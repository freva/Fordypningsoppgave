\section*{Abstract}
In recent years, micro-blogging on the Internet has become a popular way of expressing your thoughts and feelings. Twitter is a social networking service specialized on the phenomena, with over 320 million monthly active users world wide. The vast amount of micro-blogs posted through the service on a daily basis makes it a great data source of opinionated texts. In field of Sentiment Analysis or opinion mining, in which the aim is to automatically extract the sentimental orientation of a text, there has been a shift towards the opinionated Twitter data. This shift has led to an entire new field of study: Twitter Sentiment Analysis. \\

This specialization report consists of research within the field of Twitter Sentiment Analysis, in which the state-of-the-art is identified, and an architectural overview of our implementation of a Twitter Sentiment Analysis system is described. \\

With the main goal of simplicity and runtime performance we created a hybrid of two existing TSA systems developed at NTNU. The result is a system that performs on par with the best while having a runtime right in between the two systems.
